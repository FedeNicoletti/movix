The project is a website that allows users to watch movies. It is built using the latest version of React (React 18) and leverages its cutting-edge features. The application utilizes React hooks for efficient state management, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.

To maintain a clean and scalable codebase, the project follows an organized folder structure. Additionally, global state management is implemented using Redux Toolkit, enabling easy sharing of data across different components.

Data is fetched from a REST API using Axios, allowing seamless integration with external movie databases. Custom hooks are created to encapsulate reusable logic and enhance code modularity.

The website features a carousel/slider for intuitive movie browsing, and infinite scrolling functionality for effortless navigation through the movie collection. React Router DOM version 6 is employed for efficient and seamless routing within the application.

To enhance user experience during data loading, a loading skeleton is displayed, providing visual feedback while fetching movie information from the API. The project also includes robust error handling, ensuring that users are informed of any issues that may arise, such as 404 forbidden pages.

The responsive layout of the website ensures that it adapts perfectly to different screen sizes, thanks to strategically placed media queries. This guarantees an optimal viewing experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Overall, this project showcases your expertise in utilizing the latest React features, implementing state management, fetching data from APIs, creating custom hooks, designing interactive components like carousels and infinite scrolling, handling errors, and ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
